backend/core/encodings.py  --  SEAM 3.5
=======================================

The encoding registry. Owner: W4.

One EncodingSpec binds three things that MUST move together:

    qubit count   <--  qubits_for(n_features)
    scaler        <--  make_scaler()          (fitted on TRAIN only, in project.py)
    circuit       <--  template(x, wires)

Picking an encoding in the UI picks all three. They can never be mismatched
because there is no way to set one without the other two.

PennyLane only. `import qiskit` must not appear in this package.


WHY THESE FOUR, AND NOT "ANGLE + A CNOT RING"
---------------------------------------------
For a fidelity kernel K(x,y) = |<phi(x)|phi(y)>|^2, applying a FIXED unitary U
after the data encoding changes nothing:

    |<phi(x)| U-dagger U |phi(y)>|^2  ==  |<phi(x)|phi(y)>|^2

So `AngleEmbedding` followed by a ring of CNOTs produces a Gram matrix that is
numerically identical to plain `AngleEmbedding`. It looks entangled in a circuit
diagram and buys exactly zero expressivity in the kernel. `test_encodings.py`
asserts this, so nobody re-adds it by accident.

Entanglement only earns its place two ways, and the registry has one of each:

  * `zz`        -- the two-qubit rotations are DATA-DEPENDENT: RZ(f(x_i, x_j)).
  * `angle_x2`  -- re-encode AFTER entangling, so U sits between two data layers.

`angle_y` is kept deliberately as the honest product-kernel baseline. It is
efficiently simulable classically, and saying so out loud is a stronger position
in a viva than pretending otherwise. It is also the control that makes
"entanglement bought us X points" a measurable claim rather than an assertion.


SCALER RANGES ARE NOT DECORATION
--------------------------------
An encoding maps a real number onto a rotation angle. RY(0) and RY(2*pi) are the
same state, so feeding unbounded PCA output into a rotation silently wraps
distant samples onto identical states and destroys the kernel. Every spec here
declares the range its circuit is valid over. The existing Qiskit notebook fed
`X_train_raw.npy` (unscaled TruncatedSVD output) straight into a ZZ feature map;
that is exactly the bug this structure makes impossible to reproduce.

The range below is the CONVENTIONAL range for each circuit. It is not
automatically the range that generalises best -- see below.


KERNEL BANDWIDTH  (measured, not assumed)
-----------------------------------------
Fidelity kernels concentrate. Measured on 6 features / 6 qubits / 4 classes:

    ZZ, MinMax [0, 2*pi] :  mean off-diagonal K = 0.020  ->  accuracy 0.367
    ZZ, MinMax [0, 0.25] :  mean off-diagonal K = 0.361  ->  accuracy 0.867
    ZZ, MinMax [0, 0.02] :  mean off-diagonal K = 0.989  ->  accuracy 0.433

Too wide and every state is orthogonal to every other, K -> I, and the SVC
memorises the training set and generalises at chance. Too narrow and every state
is the same state, K -> J, and there is nothing to separate. The usable window
sits in between and it is NARROWER for `zz` than for `angle_y`, because the
pairwise term (pi - x_i)(pi - x_j) grows quadratically in the input scale.

So the correct bandwidth is not a property of the encoding alone -- it also
moves with n_features. Hardcoding it here would be a guess. Instead the scalers
below fix the conventional range, and the quantum models take a `bandwidth`
multiplier that is cross-validated on the training set alongside C. See
models_quantum.QSVCModel.

This is a known result (Shaydulin & Wild 2022; Canatar et al. 2022) and it is
worth a slide: an untuned quantum kernel can look worse than chance for reasons
that have nothing to do with whether quantum helps.

    concern, and `AmplitudeEmbedding(pad_with=0.0)` already does it -- padding
    with zeros preserves the L2 norm, so there is nothing to re-normalise
    afterwards. Doing it here instead would widen X from N columns to
    2^ceil(log2 N) and break the invariant: the model was constructed for

    reject it. That is how this comment came to exist.)
